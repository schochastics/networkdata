#' Centrality literature network
#' @description In 1979, Linton Freeman published a paper which defined several kinds of centrality. His typology has become the standard for network analysis. Freeman, however, was not the first to publish on centrality in networks. His paper is part of a discussion which dates back to the 1940s. The network shows the papers that discuss network centrality and their cross- references until 1979. Arcs represent citations; they point from the cited paper to the citing paper.
#'
#'In principle, papers can only cite papers which appeared earlier, so the network is acyclic. Arcs never point back to older papers just like parents cannot be younger than their children. However, there are usually some exceptions in a citation network: papers which cite one another, e.g., papers appearing at about the same time and written by one author. We eliminated these exceptions by shrinking the papers by an author which are connected by cyclic citations. In the centrality literature network, we used the latter approach (e.g., two publications by Gilch in 1954 are shrunk to one paper #GilchSW-54).

#' Words in David Copperfield
#' @description A network of common adjective and noun adjacencies for the novel "David Copperfield" by Charles Dickens, as described by M. Newman. Nodes represent the most commonly occurring adjectives and nouns in the book. Edges connect any pair of words that occur in adjacent position in the text of the book.

#' Game of Thrones Interactions
#' @description Character Interaction Networks for the HBO Series "Game of Thrones" (Season 1-7).
#' These networks were created by parsing fan-generated scripts from https://genius.com/artists/Game-of-thrones.
#' Pairs of characters are connected by (undirected) edges weighted by the number of interactions.
#'
#'\preformatted{
#'There are five interaction types. Character A and Character B are connected whenever:
#'
#' Character A speaks directly after Character B
#' Character A speaks about Character B
#' Character C speaks about Character A and Character B
#' Character A and Character B are mentioned in the same stage direction
#' Character A and Character B appear in a scene together

#' Simplified football results
#' @description A list of 112 networks of football leagues.
#' A directed link between team A and B indicates that A won a match against B. Note that there can also be an edge from B to A, since most leagues play a double round robin. For the sake of simplicity, all draws were deleted so that there could also be null ties between two teams if both games ended in a draw.
#' The data can be used to experiment with the triad census
