\description{
Species: \emph{Gopherus agassizii}

Taxonomic class: Reptilia

Population type: free-ranging

Geographical location: Nevada, USA

Data collection technique: radio tags

Interaction type: social projection bipartite

Definition of interaction: A bipartite network was first constructed based on burrow use - an edge connecting a tortoise node to a burrow node indicated burrow use by the individual. Social networks of desert tortoises were then constructed by the bipartite network into a single-mode projection of tortoise nodes.

Edge weight type: unweighted

Total duration of data collection: 8 months

Time resolution of data collection (within a day):

Time span of data collection (within a day): focal follow/ad libitum

Note: Networks represent social data collected over different years and inactive (November�February)/active (March�October) season.
